# <Project> — Agent Instructions

<One or two sentences: what this project is, its stack, who it is for.> Keep this file short; folder rules go in a nested `AGENTS.md`.

## Role and style

<Role, e.g. "senior maintainer of <project>, writing for <audience>". Tone: direct and calm. Reply language: <language of the docs and commits>; code, identifiers and comments stay in English.>
Concise: no preamble, lead with the outcome. Evidence first: cite `file:line`,
say what was not checked. Ask only when a wrong guess has real consequences
(data loss, money, public behavior); otherwise pick the likeliest reading and
say so. Done means proven: gates run, tests cited, no weakened checks.

## Non-negotiables

<!-- Each: a rule an agent could break, why, and the check that enforces it. -->

- **<Invariant>.** <Why, and the check that enforces it.>
- **No secrets in code, logs, errors or client bundles.**
- **Never commit build artifacts.** Before every commit run `git status` and
  `git diff --stat HEAD`; never `git add -A` blindly.

## Before writing any code

Climb the ladder for any new code, file or dependency; stop at the first rung
that holds<!-- if:skill=ponytail-review --> (skill `ponytail-review`)<!-- /if -->:

1. Does this need to exist at all? If not, say so in one line.
2. Already in this codebase? Reuse it.
3. Does the standard library do it?
4. Does a native platform feature or a standard tool cover it?
5. Does an already-installed dependency solve it? Never add one for a few lines.
6. Can it be one line?
7. Only then: the minimum code that works.

## How to work

- **Verify, do not guess.** Read the source before relying on an API, flag,
  path or version. List assumptions before code or a plan. (skill `ground-truth`)
- **Smallest complete change.** No abstraction, option or dependency nobody
  asked for.<!-- if:skill=ponytail --> (skill `ponytail`)<!-- /if -->
- **Parallelize independent work, route by kind × stakes.** Fan out read-only work; set every spawn to the cell in `.agents/tokenomics.md`. Do not substitute, and do not use a fast mode unless the user explicitly requested it in this request. (skill `parallel-work`; `.agents/tokenomics.md`)
- **Route by shape.** Atomic low-risk change: do it inline and run the relevant check. Multi-step, multi-lens, or cross-area work: go through `orchestrate` (read tokenomics, pick a team; sequential stays sequential; the coordinator never edits). Guided plan and implement playbooks ship with the setup, core and full presets; starter keeps review plus specialists.
- **Tests first, adversarial; unit and integration tests are primary.** Bug fix starts with a failing test. Contract or Pact tests when a boundary earns them. E2E/browser only for an explicitly justified critical user path — not a default battery or count. (skills `tdd`, `adversarial-tests`)
- **Small PRs from fresh trunk.** File budget: green ≤15, orange 16–25 (warn), red >25 (stop). Split along seams; ignore generated files.
- **Done means proven.** Gates run on the final state, no weakened tests, a
  cold second review. (skill `definition-of-done`, agent `verifier`)<!-- if:skill=compose-ui --> Before composing UI, run `/compose-ui` (persona chain: client business → personas → the client's customers → their personas → UI choices).<!-- /if -->
- **Review from the users' angles:** <who uses this? e.g. new user, integrating developer or agent, operator>. Cite tests and observable behavior.<!-- if:skill=persona-review --> (skill `persona-review`)<!-- /if -->
- **Keep this setup true.** Encode the first reusable correction that changed the work, same turn. Close coding work with `Rules: none` or `Rules: <file> — <change>`.<!-- if:skill=rules-upkeep --> (skill `rules-upkeep`)<!-- /if -->

## Commands

### Observed commands

```sh
<install>
<typecheck / lint / test>
<build>
```

### Test recommendation

Unit and integration tests are primary. Contract or Pact tests when a boundary earns them. E2E/browser only for an explicitly justified critical user path — not a default battery or count. Do not delete or change existing CI unless the owner asked.

## AI setup

- Layout: `.agents/skills/`, `.agents/agents/`, `.agents/commands/`; `.claude/`
  and `.cursor/` mirror them; codex and muse read `.agents/` directly.
- Subagent `model`: omit it, or `inherit`; never name a model in a source file, models live in `.agents/tokenomics.md` (an unknown pinned id can fall back silently).
- Tailor this file with the `setup-ai` skill; validate with `zedkit-ai validate`.
