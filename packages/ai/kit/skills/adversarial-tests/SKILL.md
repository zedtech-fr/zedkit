# Adversarial tests

Tests that only show the code working prove little. Aim them at how it breaks. A suite of happy paths gives false confidence.

## Pick the test type first

| Test | Use it for | Not for |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | one decision: guard, branch, mapping, error classification | full flows, wiring |
| Integration (real DB, real queue or in-memory fake that behaves) | data access, transactions, constraints | logic branches |
| End-to-end through the public entry (HTTP, message, CLI) | the contract: the success case, each documented failure, garbage input | every internal branch |

Do not mock the database or the thing under test. Fake only what you do not own (network, clock, third parties).

## Attack list

Take every item that applies to the code. At least one test per relevant item.

**Inputs**
- Each optional parameter as `null`, as `undefined`, and omitted. `false` and `0` versus missing.
- Empty string, array, object. Zero, negative, `NaN`, `Infinity`, max safe integer.
- Too long, odd characters, unicode, injection strings.

**Shapes**
- Required field missing. Present but `null`. Wrong type. Extra unknown fields. Array where one value is expected, and the reverse.

**Dependencies**
- Throws: is the error propagated, not swallowed or rewrapped?
- Returns `undefined`, an empty list, or a value missing optional fields.
- Slow, timing out, answering 5xx or a malformed body.

**State and time**
- Calling again with identical input: is the second call harmless?
- Two concurrent calls: race, lost update?
- Wrong order: finish before start, act on a deleted item.
- Unknown enum or version value: a newer producer must not crash an older consumer.

**Business rules**
- Valid shape that breaks a rule. Cross-tenant or cross-user access: denied and indistinguishable from "not found".

## Rules

- A bug fix starts with a test that fails for the right reason.
- Name tests by behavior ("rejects expired token"), not by function.
- One reason to fail per test. No logic (loops, branches) inside tests.
- Deterministic: no real network, no wall clock, no shared state between tests.
- Removing or loosening a test needs a written reason in the PR.

## Self-check before done

For each function, handler or endpoint written or changed:

- [ ] Happy path, in the right test type
- [ ] Each guard clause and early exit is exercised by a test
- [ ] Each error type it can raise is asserted somewhere
- [ ] Null, empty and unknown-value inputs, where accepted
- [ ] Each collaborator failing, and returning nothing
- [ ] Duplicate delivery or repeat call, where it can happen
- [ ] A test that would fail if the main branch of the code were deleted
