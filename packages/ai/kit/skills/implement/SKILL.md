Implement the work described by the user in the spec or tickets.

Refuse a missing or unchallenged plan: run `challenge` (or `plan`, when there is nothing yet) first.

If the user passes a ticket reference, fetch it from the issue tracker and state its title before starting. If the reference is ambiguous, ask.

Before writing code, climb the `ponytail-review` ladder for every new piece
of code, file, or dependency — need to exist? in this codebase? standard
library? native platform feature or a standard tool? installed dependency?
one line? else the minimum code that works — and stop at the first rung that
holds. Stop and replan any piece where a higher rung holds.

Call the Skill tool with "tdd" where possible, at pre-agreed seams.

Run typechecking regularly, single test files regularly, and the full test suite once at the end.

Then pass `definition-of-done`, and call the Skill tool with "review" to review the work.

Commit your work to the current branch.
