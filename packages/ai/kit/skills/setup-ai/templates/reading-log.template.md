# Reading log

Written in phase B to `.agents/setup-log/reading.md` after the readers report. `npx @zedtech/zedkit-ai validate --setup` checks it (axis D1): one numbered row per reader, scaled to the repo (see `npx @zedtech/zedkit-ai scan`), plus `file:line` evidence, and a run-budget statement.

**Repo size:** {small|medium|large} ({n} files) — {n} readers, one per slice (from `npx @zedtech/zedkit-ai scan`).
**Cell:** readers ran as `check` at `trivial`/`standard` ({model or `inherit`}); synthesis as `decide` at `sensitive` or above. See `.agents/tokenomics.md`.
**Budget:** {A1 run budget, or `none found`} — every reader stayed within it. The only overrun allowed is owner-approved, one line under **Budget exceptions**.
**Budget exceptions:** none — or `owner-approved: reader {n} read {x} files (budget {y}), approved by interview Q{k}`.

| Slice | Reader paths       | Kind  | Rules | Spot-checked                  | Conflicts | Gaps |
| ----- | ------------------ | ----- | ----- | ----------------------------- | --------- | ---- |
| 1     | `apps/web`         | check | 14    | 3/3 opened, 3 held            | 1         | 2    |
| 2     | `packages/billing` | check | 9     | 3/3 opened, 2 held, 1 dropped | 0         | 1    |

## Rule map

Every rule or skill file the repo already owns for one provider (Cursor `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` with `globs:`, folder-level `<folder>/.cursor/rules` and `skills`, `.claude/rules`) is invisible to the other providers. One row per file, by full path (`npx @zedtech/zedkit-ai validate --setup` checks that none is missing). Never copy the law: one law, one owner.

| File                                         | Scope (globs or folder) | Decision              | Where other providers find it                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.cursor/rules/12-architecture.mdc`          | `packages/**`           | kept as owner         | `packages/core/AGENTS.md` points at it with a one-line summary |
| `services/billing/.cursor/rules/00-team.mdc` | `services/billing`      | mirrored by pointer   | `services/billing/AGENTS.md`                                   |
| `.cursor/rules/search.mdc`                   | all                     | not a rule: tool hint | none                                                           |

Refresh after phase C, once the nested files exist: each pointer cell must name a nested `AGENTS.md` that exists and names the rule file. Then add `rule-map: refreshed after phase C ({n} rows changed)` here.

## Policy docs

Playbooks, ADRs, vision and runbooks that state rules. Each lands in a domain, design or nested file (cite its path), or is marked `not a rule: <reason>`.

| Doc                                     | Lands in                    | Or                      |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `docs/playbooks/booking-concurrency.md` | `.agents/domain/booking.md` |                         |
| `docs/playbooks/lab-demo.md`            |                             | not a rule: demo script |

## Merged rules

Rules the lead kept after dedupe and spot-checks. These feed `.agents/domain/*.md`, `.agents/design.md`, nested `AGENTS.md` files and `AGENTS.md`.

| ID   | Lane   | Status  | Rule                                                               | Evidence                            | Lands in                     |
| ---- | ------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| R2-1 | domain | current | Refunds are capped at the captured amount.                         | `packages/billing/src/refund.ts:31` | `.agents/domain/billing.md`  |
| R3-4 | domain | current | A webhook event and its outbox row are written in one transaction. | `src/webhooks/ingest.ts:86`         | `.agents/domain/webhooks.md` |

## Meaning check

Written after the checkers report (see `templates/rule-check-brief.template.md`). One row per checked rule; every rule about order, atomicity, timing, retries or idempotency is here, the rest are sampled. A `partial` or `mismatch` needs a resolution: `rewritten` (the merged rule now says what the code does), `dropped`, or `conflict` (the doc's claim is kept as a code vs docs conflict). `npx @zedtech/zedkit-ai validate --setup` fails on an unresolved row and on an order or atomicity rule with no row.

| ID   | Verdict  | Code does                                                   | Resolution |
| ---- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| R2-1 | match    | caps the refund at the captured amount                      |            |
| R3-4 | mismatch | stores the event and the outbox row in the same transaction | rewritten  |

## Interview gaps

Only what the code did not answer. Each interview question cites one of these.

| Gap   | Why the code cannot answer                                         | Question                                 |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| R2-G1 | docs say 24h, code says 48h (`README.md:40` vs `src/cancel.ts:12`) | Which cancellation window is the policy? |

## Found in code, confirm

Rules shown to the owner as "found in code — confirm?" in the same message as the interview (not counted as questions).

- R1-3 — {rule} — `file:line`
