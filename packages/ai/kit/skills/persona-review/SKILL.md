# Persona review

A change can be correct and still useless to the person it is for. Name the audience, run their real task, report what you observed.

## Steps

1. **Name the recipient** of the deliverable and the task they are trying to do. If the repo's docs do not say, ask.
2. **Pick 2 to 4 personas** whose view differs. Common ones:

| Persona | Question |
|---|---|
| New user | Can I do the task from the README and examples alone? |
| Integrating developer or coding agent | Are the contract, errors and failure semantics clear without reading the implementation? |
| Operator or maintainer | Can I see what happened, repair it, and replay it without losing data? |
| Security reviewer | Can I verify isolation, authorization and secret handling from tests and code? |
| Business owner | Does it solve the stated problem, and what does it cost to adopt? |

3. **Run the task as each persona.** Follow the real path: copy the quickstart, call the endpoint, read the error, break the input. Do not reason from the diff alone.
4. **Back each verdict with evidence**: a command and its output, a test name, a file and line, a screenshot. No evidence, no verdict.
5. **Report per persona**: Pass, Pass with a rough edge, or Fail. Name the rough edge and the owner or next step. State honest gaps instead of hiding them.

## In parallel

Personas are independent. Give each to a subagent with the brief from `parallel-work` (deliverable, task, how to run it, output shape), then merge. Pair persona review with deterministic tests: personas find what tests do not think of, tests keep it from regressing.

## Output

```
Persona: <name> — task: <what they try>
Verdict: Pass | Pass with rough edge | Fail
Evidence: <command/test/file:line>
Gap: <what is missing, and next step>
```
