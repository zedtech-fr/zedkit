# Lens registry

One row per review lens. `review` routes over this table: path/type ->
mandatory lenses. Runner `Status` `planned` means the skill/agent does not
exist yet (kit-agents roadmap): the lens reports skipped-planned with its
reason in the lenses-run table, never a blocker and never silent, until the
runner lands. A preset that omits a runner is a product choice to record, not
an automatic blocker. Skipping a mandatory lens whose runner
exists IS a blocker.

A `registry.json` or registry CSS payload in the diff is part of the
doc-demos lens. Check that payload by compiling it. The app that imports
the package stylesheet does not cover the copy path.

At `Stakes: sensitive` or higher the full lens set runs: every lens whose
trigger matches the diff is mandatory, and an "optional" lens is not skipped.
Route each lens agent with `zedkit-ai route <agent> --kind check --stakes <s> --provider <active-tool>`
and check the printed `provider:` matches the active tool, then pass that
model id exactly. Do not substitute, and do not use a fast
mode unless the user explicitly requested it in this request.
A review may raise the stakes and writes `Stakes raised: <old> -> <new>: <reason>`;
it never lowers them. At `critical` a second, independent review runs in a
separate session (`route ... --stakes critical` gives its route; when the model
is `inherit`, name the model that session used) and the PR carries `Second review:`
and `Human validation:` lines before merge. A `check` call that changed
`git status --porcelain` fails the step.

## Frontend rules (the `ui` lens fails the review on any of these)

1. One demo = one file (`demos/<name>.tsx` or colocated with its doc).
   No grab-bag module importing dozens of components.
2. Demos render inside one shared frame (title, description,
   light/dark preview, shown source, props link), consumed by the doc
   through a demo registry (key -> demo), never by direct page imports.
3. Doc pages stay thin: load content + doc layout only. No direct
   imports of dozens of components.
4. Zero raw structural HTML and zero ad-hoc styles in demos and doc
   pages: structure comes from `Stack`/`Section`/`Heading`/`Text` from the
   kit (visually hidden text is `Text as="span"` with `sr-only`), utilities
   are tokens only.
5. A lint rule or test bans bulk imports in doc pages (it fails on the
   grab-bag it replaces, passes after).
6. Motion that explains a transition or preserves context (overlay
   entry/exit, list reorder, focus-following panel), with reduced-motion
   respected (fade or instant, never displacement). Not required on every
   state change; instant is fine for small feedback. Example refusal: a
   modal that appears with no fade and hides what changed.
7. Loading and feedback named, never naked: where a wait exists, there are
   zero naked spinners and zero generic 'loading' — it names what loads,
   skeletons match the real content shape, retry keeps state. A page or
   example with no wait has no loading state.
   Example refusal: a spinner with no label on a slow save.
8. A docs-side CSS override of a kit component is a blocking `ui`
   finding unless it is a documented local one-off the kit cannot yet
   express. Fix a defect in a token, primitive, or shared component at
   that layer (`ui-designer` Owner) with a component test.

<!-- if:skill=compose-ui -->

The `ui` lens also fails when the change is visual and there is no
`/compose-ui` persona-chain brief (client business → personas → the client's
customers → their personas → UI choices) with a `because` on each UI decision.
