  - @zedtech/zedkit-core@0.2.0

## 0.7.2

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 43afbd0: Refactor test name resolvers into one shared helper with identical behavior.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- e59db59: Remove the deprecated `plan-challenger` alias as promised for 0.6.0; briefs must name `skeptic` with an angle.

### Patch Changes

- @zedtech/zedkit-core@0.1.3

## 0.6.5

### Patch Changes

## 0.6.4

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 2b35617: Add the `console-architecture` agent (route/view/data layer-boundary reviewer for frontend changes) and wire it in the lens registry and agents catalog.
- 83e0f67: Activate the `doc-demos` review lens (registry + frame + drift checks for doc apps and demo registries); both runners (`docs-writer`, `ui-designer`) already exist.
- e39bfe7: Add the `orchestrator` agent plus `orchestrate` and `research` commands for multi-step coordination across existing playbooks and specialists.
- 8ffe2f5: Add the `product-director` agent (one-page delivery brief over a scope: shipped/next/needs/risks with links) and wire it in the agents catalog.
- e900417: Add the `release-manager` agent (release gatekeeper: semver 0.x rules, changesets, migration notes, deprecations, maturity) and wire it in the lens registry and agents catalog.

### Patch Changes

- de8f031: Test that the agents catalog Writes column matches each agent's frontmatter write guards.
- e848e85: Test that `docs/agents-catalog.md` covers every agent the kit ships.
- d38aefd: Ship the `audit` skill in the `core` preset: the `audit` command always installs, so a fresh core install failed its own `validate`.
- 308f534: Bound the agents-catalog chains and persona-fallback test parsers to their sections so later doc additions cannot leak in.
- a5266f7: Test that every Typical chains name in docs/agents-catalog.md resolves to a skill, agent or command the kit ships.
- 46a4592: Name the removal version (0.6.0) on the deprecated `plan-challenger` alias, in the agent description and the agents catalog.
- ae91eb5: CLI errors carry next steps (`unexpected argument` points at `--help`, `no such directory` points at the project root or `init`); validate-errors doc example fixed (`diagnosing-bugs`, not `audit`, needs `--preset full`).
- b7f21d3: Test that the package README documents every CLI usage flag.
- 2c885df: List the first-party `audit` skill in THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES and cover `use-zedkit` in the core-closure test list.
- 5e86c2f: Test that every kit command routes to its same-named skill with the $ARGUMENTS contract.
- 7f2b740: Move `diagnosing-bugs` from the `core` preset to full-only (still shipped; fresh core installs stay lean) and cap the core preset size by test.
- 5a048ad: Test that re-running `init` against a newer kit adds new files without touching edited ones.
- 8bbf647: Lock both agents tables to exactly the shipped agent set: fail on stale rows, not just missing ones.
- 951ff68: Test that `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` names every shipped skill.
- 7963a67: Align persona-review fallback generics with personas.template.md and lock the persona name set with a test.
- 2c885df: Ship the `ponytail-audit` skill in the `core` preset: the core `audit` skill runs it, so core installs referenced a missing skill.
- 2775028: Name the `skeptic` agent in the README entry-points paragraph: `challenge` briefs `skeptic`, not the deprecated alias.
- 300a492: Test that the README command list matches the manifest and command files stay thin.
- 3f51547: Fix stale README inventories: complete the first-party skills list and point subagents at the agents catalog instead of a frozen subset.
- f6db15d: Ship the `research` skill in the `core` preset: the core `wayfinder` skill invokes it via the Skill tool.
- 81e9503: Miss-to-rule from downstream propagation: setup-ai verify now requires the repo lint to ignore installed kit dirs.
- 05eb888: Teach setup-ai to replace local copies of published zedkit configs with the install (propagation prep).
- 862989a: Align the `setup-ai` subagent guidance with the kit convention: `model` omitted or `inherit`.
- 0dc1ad8: Document why skills are exempt from the single-line description rule and lock folded descriptions as valid.
- 28ea655: Test that shipped skills partition exactly into first-party plus upstream notices, and that the README first-party list matches.
- b0e21c1: AGENTS template states the subagent `model` rule as omit-or-`inherit`, matching the skill and the validator; test pins the three wordings together.
- 89c7b6b: Test that bare skill/agent/command names in the kit templates resolve to shipped content.
- e85fb10: Point the `use-zedkit` skill links at absolute public URLs: repo-relative links break once installed in a consumer repo.
- be8a56c: Test that the root README consumer snippet stays identical to the use-zedkit core rule.
- e4b6ee7: Validate-errors doc matches the CLI summary (`1 problem` / `N problems`); test pins documented error strings to source.
- f55bd78: Pluralize the `validate` summary (`1 problem` / `N problems`).
- f0908dc: Test that the agents catalog Writes column only holds yes, no or tests only.
- Updated dependencies [4a1b579]
  - @zedtech/zedkit-core@0.1.3

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 4024c51: Add the `docs-writer` agent (docs author for README/AGENTS.md/catalog entries; grounded examples, de-drift) and wire it in the lens registry and agents catalog.
- ca6694c: Add the `researcher` read-only reuse-by-design scout (adopt/wrap/build with sources); the `research` skill now delegates to it and the lens row names it.
- 16ef547: Add the `test-writer` agent (adversarial test author; test files only) and wire it in the lens registry and agents catalog.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9167ada: Add the `dependency-auditor` agent (need/size/license/maintenance/duplicates/supply-chain checks for new or updated deps) and wire it in the lens registry and agents catalog.
- 9618386: Gentle motion by default + reduced-motion everywhere: requirement in `ui-designer`, rule 6 of the ui lens (with refusal example), both personas, and the `verifier` gate; content test locks it.

### Patch Changes

- 03cacd0: Catalog: every need documents its short name, audience, purpose, when to (not) use it, and related needs (single-sourced from CATALOG.md, enforced by `pnpm catalog:check`), feeding the doc pages.
- Updated dependencies [03cacd0]
  - @zedtech/zedkit-core@0.1.2

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- fa3b613: Add the `copywriter` read-only i18n-first microcopy reviewer (keys, tone, doubtful-client bar, FR/EN proposals); flip the `copy` lens to exists.
- b99b3c4: Quality loop: `frontend-quality` + `doc-demos` lens rows (planned until their runners land), miss-to-rule step in `review`, new `audit` skill + command with content tests.
- 1a858c7: Enrich the lazy end-client persona with interrupted and flaky-network bars (auto-save, resume where left off, reload-safe idempotent flows) and add the Stressed user persona (named loading feedback, no naked spinners); matching checks in `ui-designer` and the `skeptic` ui/ux angle.
- d5ba31f: Add the `seo-auditor` and `a11y-auditor` read-only reviewers (seo package rules; WCAG basics); flip both lenses to exists.
- 0c81d35: Add the `ui-designer` read-only UI reviewer (kit reuse, states, responsive, themes, lazy-client bar) and `docs/agents-catalog.md` (when to call which agent, typical chains); flip the `ui` lens to exists.

### Patch Changes

- 3809828: Lens registry: docs trigger also covers agents and commands (dogfood finding — new kit content matched no content lens).
- b35e593: Fix two pre-review findings: `audit` skill says owner (not the internal lanes term), `copywriter` key rule scoped to products with i18n.
- 59a12be: Discoverability: benefit-oriented descriptions, 8–12 npm keywords, homepage and bugs links per package (single-sourced from the CATALOG.md header, enforced by `pnpm catalog:check`), plus README badges and Install/Usage/When-to-use sections.
- Updated dependencies [59a12be]
  - @zedtech/zedkit-core@0.1.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 93b16af: Add the review lens registry (`skills/review/lenses.md`): `review` now routes path/type to mandatory lenses over one table, with a lenses-run report and a resolver test.
- c515c4e: Personas as data: kit `personas.template.md` installed to `.agents/personas.md` (existing file kept), `persona-review` reads it with a generic fallback, `setup-ai` customizes it per project.
- ba05241: Replace `plan-challenger` with one generic `skeptic` agent (angle per brief: plan, ui/ux, security, scope, data/ops, copy); `plan-challenger` stays as a deprecated alias for one release. Lens registry updated (single skeptic row), lens test asserts trigger/output columns.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7426a08: Initial release: agent-agnostic AI kit (AGENTS.md template, skills, subagents), installer and validator.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [48b6f4a]
