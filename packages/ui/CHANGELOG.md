## 0.9.2

### Patch Changes

- 45657b6: Unify the site type scale across identities: shared `--text-*` steps (12/13/14px ladder, 15px prose) and semantic `--zk-type-*` roles. **16px is for form controls on mobile only** (`--zk-input-font-size`), not body copy. Identities keep font family, colour, and tracking only.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 0d2c6f2: Add Playwright visual regression baselines for the UI gallery smoke tests.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- c4d1155: useValidatedForm ties form values to zod schema input and submit payload to schema output. Migration: drop the manual generic — `useValidatedForm(schema)` instead of `useValidatedForm<MyFields>(schema)`.

### Patch Changes

- ffc4639: Controlled DatePicker and DateRangePicker respect a parent clearing `value` instead of falling back to internal state.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- bd933e1: MultiSelect honors disabled on chip removal and emits one value change per removal.
- 2ba2950: Pagination Previous and Next use `type="button"` so they no longer submit an enclosing form.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- d6c58ea: Publish the prop types for input, popover, tooltip, dropdown menu, fieldset, select, textarea, and checkbox so their doc pages can list them.
- 9b70bcd: Let Stack use gaps 5 and 7, the steps that were missing between 4, 6, and 8.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- b8cb610: Additive type exports `DialogProps` and `FormFieldProps`, naming the props
  `Dialog` and `FormField` already accepted (same pattern as `TabsProps`).
  They let the docs generator render Props tables for the modal-dialogs and
  validated-forms pages, which shipped without one.
- 0bdc423: Preset switches no longer destroy custom identity work: `applyIdentity`
  parks the stored custom sheet (it is scoped to one look, so it stays inert
  under other looks and applies again on switch-back, matching the boot
  script after reload) instead of deleting it. Explicit resets use the new
  `discardCustomIdentity` export. A look-less `applyCustomIdentity` now
  scopes its sheet to the `custom` look instead of writing unscoped `:root`
  CSS.
- 548daca: Add layout tokens and primitives: container width tokens (narrow, reading, default, wide), identity-derived page gutter and section spacing steps, a `Container` component, and a full-bleed mode on `Section` (edge-to-edge band, optional muted tone, capped inner content). Existing `Section` rendering is unchanged without the new props.
- 00d57d4: Add a `multiline` prop to SecretField: the value renders wrapped in an
  auto-growing read-only textarea so long values (install commands, short
  snippets) read in full on narrow screens instead of truncating mid-token.
  Default rendering is unchanged. Also registers the spacing-token min-height
  utilities as one conflict group in `cn`, so token min-height overrides win
  like stock ones.

### Patch Changes

- 8bbe961: Apply compact identity colours to sidebar, card and muted chrome, not only page background.
- 5c23276: Show a named identity (`n-…`) as the selected option in IdentitySwitcher and IdentityPicker when it is not already in the list, so the control stays named.
- f50e3f4: Restore a stored named identity id with its custom sheet, and apply named looks without clearing that sheet.
- ea32cde: Keep destructive buttons and destructive text at WCAG AA contrast in every identity, light and dark.
- e725040: Name a Section from a string title (`aria-label`) and still render `description` when there is no title.

## 0.7.3

### Patch Changes

- 3605166: Apply the editor look as the site identity (light and dark) and overlay compact token edits.
- ac2f27f: Apply compact identity tokens to the whole page (`applyCustomIdentity`) and restore them before paint.
- 86460fb: WCAG 1.4.11 non-text contrast warnings for identity accent and border vs background.
- caaaab4: Nudge shipped identity accent and border lightness to 3:1 against background.
- a2711ad: WCAG AA contrast warnings for identity foreground/background pairs in light and dark.
- b846361: Keep a manual dark identity colour when a later light edit rewrites the pair.
- 0ab08f4: Derive an AA dark colour pair from identity light colours.
- 87d1912: Identity token schema (light and dark colour pair) and a CSS variable writer for a scoped look.
- 9f63ac8: Glass `--zk-border-width` is 0.5px (Mist stays 1px). Glass `--zk-shadow-xs` is a float, not a 1px contact lift. Maison `--zk-shadow-md` is a 1px ink line, not a soft drop. Tide, Press, and Volt borders stay. Volt/Maison stay thin so the phone search sheet still fits its results.
- 636aae6: Maison `--zk-body-leading` is no longer next to Mist (1.6). Maison is 2. Glass stays 1.85. Tide stays 1.35. Mist is unchanged.
- e512b87: Input is kit-authored. Height, block padding, and font size still use `--spacing` control tokens. Inline padding stays Tailwind `px-3`. `py-control-block` is unchanged (identity-aware and shared with other controls).

- d5b4083: Docs e2e: smoke every published `/r/<brick>.json` URL (sync with registry.json).
- bc37bac: `Card` and `CardSkeleton` use `shadow-md`, so they pick up each identity's `--zk-shadow-md` (press stays flat; tide/glass read as deeper). Mist cards are one step stronger than the old `shadow` utility.
- 6921e0c: Glass `--zk-border-width` is a finer hairline (0.75px), no longer Mist's 1px. Maison still 1px. Mist is unchanged.
- e6f4bb3: Glass dark `--zk-shadow-xs` is no longer `none` (Maison keeps that). Dark glass now uses a faint drop plus the glass highlight. Tracking was already unique. Mist is unchanged.
- a99d702: Glass light `--zk-shadow-xs` no longer matches Tide's 1px/2px shape. Glass is `0 1px 3px` at 0.07. Tracking uniqueness now covers heading and label too. Mist is unchanged.

- b4a015e: Press, tide, and glass each have their own `--spacing` unit (0.24 / 0.28 / 0.27rem). Mist stays at 0.25rem; volt and maison keep 0.225rem and 0.3rem. No two looks share the spacing scale.
- 81ff3a0: Per-identity `--zk-body-leading`, `--zk-border-width`, and `--zk-color-duration` (`transition-colors` follows the last). Mist stays at 1.6 / 1px / 150ms. Press is firmer and faster (2px, 1.45, 80ms); maison and glass more open and slower; tide and volt each their own. Unused `--zk-density` and `--zk-control-scale` are removed (`--spacing` is the density knob).
- e2e5e83: Each identity now has its own type size, tracking, and shadow. Mist stays on the kit defaults (0.875rem / −0.025em / the stock shadow). Press, maison, glass, tide and volt no longer share those values with each other or with mist.

- 0f0f526: Maison light `--zk-shadow-overlay` no longer sits on the same 24px lift as Glass. Maison is a paper contact edge plus `0 20px 44px`, like its other depth steps. Mist is unchanged.
- 8207cf1: Press heading line-height no longer matches Mist's 1.1 fallback. Press `--zk-heading-leading` is 1.06. Tracking was already unique. Mist is unchanged.
- 63603ac: Press `--text-xs` is no longer Mist/Volt's 0.75rem (12px). Press is 0.6875rem. Tracking and body leading were already unique. Mist is unchanged.
- c03a996: Adds `--zk-gap-sm`, `--zk-gap-md`, `--zk-gap-lg`, `--zk-icon-size`, and `--zk-control-height`, each `calc()` from `--spacing` (mist matches today's rem). No component classes change in this release; deprecated `--spacing-*` aliases keep their rem values.
- ab21d41: Alert block padding uses Tailwind `py-3` (0.75rem). `--spacing-alert-block` stays as a deprecated alias so existing class names still work.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- d601632: Add `BrandLogo`: render your own brand mark as an inline SVG that follows `currentColor`, with a required accessible name. `Logo` stays the zedkit mark used by the docs site.
- fdccf34: Adds `Calendar`, `DatePicker`, and `DateRangePicker` as thin wrappers over react-day-picker. Pickers open in the existing Popover. Locale and prev/next names follow `ZedkitUiProvider`.
- 3053f13: Add `Combobox` and `MultiSelect` (downshift + popover), export `PopoverAnchor`, docs demos, and tests.
- a4927e3: Adds `EmptyState`, `ErrorState`, and `Spinner`. Pass `description` and `actions` (no aliases). Spinner reads its accessible name from `ZedkitUiProvider` (`loading`); a `label` prop wins.
- cd1a0ff: Kit chrome (Close, Filter…, empty, loading) reads from `ZedkitUiProvider`. English is the default; pass `zedkitUiMessagesFr` or your own copy. A per-host label prop still wins. Upgrade notes: docs/migrations/ui-ref-and-messages.md.
- 58ec8cd: Adds `Popover`, `Tooltip`, and `DropdownMenu` as thin Radix wrappers. Tooltip delay is 0 unless you pass `delayDuration` on `TooltipProvider`.
- d074cfd: UI hosts take `ref` as a prop (`ComponentProps<"el">`) and set `data-slot` on each exported root. The quality preset flags `forwardRef` and points at `packages/ui/src/button.tsx`. Upgrade notes: docs/migrations/ui-ref-and-messages.md.

- 3b893de: Dialog caps against the visual viewport, sticks title and footer, and keeps Close above the chrome so the keyboard cannot cover them.
- 735ce47: Control icons use Tailwind `size-4` (1rem). `--spacing-icon-control` stays as a deprecated alias so existing class names still work.

- 892a099: `IdentityScript` is a static `<head>` tag (no client module). The stored look still applies before first paint; React no longer hydrates the bootstrap.
- e87f7e5: Dialog content scrolls inside a 90dvh max height. RouteModal uses the drawer sheet chrome (handle, body scroll, 44px close).
- 49e60a6: RouteModal's dialog variant has a live preview. Mobile overlay checks cover Dialog, ConfirmDialog, and RouteModal.
- c32f41b: Shared 1rem spacing aliases use Tailwind scale 4 (`p-4`, `px-4`, `gap-4`, `size-4`). The `--spacing-*` tokens stay as deprecated aliases so existing class names still work.

- dec6869: StatusDot uses Tailwind `size-2` (0.5rem). `--spacing-status-dot` stays as a deprecated alias so existing class names still work.
- 42687ee: TabsContent top gap uses Tailwind `mt-2` (0.5rem). `--spacing-tabs-content-gap` stays as a deprecated alias so existing class names still work.
- Updated dependencies [a10ad9e]
  - @zedtech/zedkit-i18n@0.2.0

## 0.6.4

### Patch Changes

- 63b1f39: fix(route-modal): restore trigger focus at unmount only

## 0.6.3

### Patch Changes

- 2df4776: IdentitySwitcher and IdentityPicker mark the identity passed as `defaultIdentity` ("(default)" in the select, "Default" in the sheet), so a site that applies a default through IdentityScript can say so.

## 0.6.2

### Patch Changes

- 7b86dba: Drop the `@custom-variant hover` redefinition: it emitted malformed CSS that broke consumer builds, and Tailwind v4's default hover variant is already hover-gated.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- af05b51: Glass identity: drawer and dialog panels are translucent, tinted and blurred, with a lighter scrim; they fall back to near-solid without backdrop-filter, with reduced transparency, or in forced colors. Drawer and dialog parts carry data-slot hooks.
- 001f6aa: Catalog: ten UI needs move from alpha to beta (metadata only, no code change).

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- d3d6a8c: Add ScrollScenes (alpha): a pinned stage that fades from scene to scene as the page scrolls, in pure CSS with native scrolling. Scenes sit one under the other under reduced motion and where scroll timelines are unsupported.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 71c7513: RouteModal drawer returns focus to the trigger on close (WCAG 2.4.3) instead of dropping it on body.
- 905202a: DetailPanelRow values wrap inside the grid instead of spilling past their boxes (grid blowout on long unbreakable ids).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 5398c86: Drawer: mobile bottom sheet (`mobile` prop), sheet height and safe-area tokens, `DrawerBody`, `DrawerCloseButton`, sticky chrome, and overlay motion tuned for phones. Left, right and top drawers now fit phones too: side panels are full height up to 90% of the width, the handle hides on sides and sits at the bottom of a top drawer, and safe-area insets are respected on every edge.
- 1ea4b9c: Add `IconLabel`: quiet inline icon + label with theme size, gap, and muted color tokens.
- c25c03e: OptionCards: card geometry uses theme tokens; adds composable `OptionCard` (data API unchanged). Migration: the `OptionCard` data interface is renamed to `OptionCardData` (name taken by the component) — replace the type name, no runtime change.
- d23d33f: List the six identities (`mist`, `press`, `tide`, `volt`, `maison`, `glass`) in the built-in `identities`: `IdentityScript`, `IdentitySwitcher` and `IdentityPicker` now offer them by default, and a stored built-in id is applied before first paint. No identity is applied until someone chooses one. Pass `identities={[]}` (or your own list) to keep the previous behaviour.
- 035ff81: Add the identity token foundation: `identities.css` (stock `--zk-*` tokens and the bridge that lets an identity restyle Tailwind utilities) and `motion.css` (reveal, stagger, hover lift and press utilities), both imported by `styles.css`. Body copy uses `leading-body` (1.6), hover styles only apply on devices that hover, and the focus ring is darker and 2px on controls.
- e5a617d: Add the `glass` identity: frosted translucent cards, popovers and code blocks over soft colour halos, hairline edges, generous radii. Surfaces turn near-solid without backdrop-filter support or when less transparency is requested. Inert until `data-identity="glass"` is set.
- c077015: Add the `maison` identity: airy ivory, Cormorant display over a Jost body, very fine borders, small radii, generous spacing, with metric-aligned fallback faces. Interactions stay within the motion caps; the slow feel is reserved for reveals. Inert until `data-identity="maison"` is set.
- 8d4b140: Add the `mist` identity: the stock look set in Inter (with a metric-aligned fallback face so the font swap does not shift the layout) and a visible text selection. Set `data-identity="mist"` on `<html>` to use it.
- 1802d22: Add the `press` identity: editorial paper and ink, square corners, 1px rules, no soft shadows, Newsreader display over a Space Grotesk body, with metric-aligned fallback faces. Inert until `data-identity="press"` is set.
- 68eb7fe: Add the identity provider and selectors: `IdentityScript` applies a stored `data-identity` before first paint, `IdentitySwitcher` (labelled select) and `IdentityPicker` (touch sheet) let people choose and persist the choice, and `applyIdentity` / `useIdentity` drive it from your own UI. The kit ships no identity yet: pass your own list, matching your `[data-identity]` CSS. Nothing changes until an identity is set.
- a600adf: Add the `tide` identity: navy and coral, Inter at heavy weights, large radii, soft glows, long eased reveals within the motion caps. Inert until `data-identity="tide"` is set.
- 974b112: Add the `volt` identity: dense near-black, Geist with a 12px xs body, hairline borders, layered depth, one acid accent, with a metric-aligned fallback face. Inert until `data-identity="volt"` is set.
- a2c8e06: Add `Logo`: the zedkit mark as an inline SVG that paints with `currentColor`, so it follows light, dark and every identity. Named image by default; pass `title=""` when the name is written next to it.
- a1c163f: Adds `useOnlineStatus` + `OfflineNote` (offline presence, part of #169).
- 32148d1: Touch-friendly controls: on touch or narrow screens, inputs, selects, textareas, buttons and tab lists reach a 44px tap height, and checkbox and switch carry an invisible 44px hit area while keeping their visible size. Mouse users keep compact heights. Dialogs keep a side gutter on phones and their close button is a full tap target, buttons get a subtle press feedback (skipped with reduced motion), invalid fields show a destructive border, wide tables fade the cut-off edge, and the data table resets to the first page when filtering and hides pagination when empty.

### Patch Changes

- f781d8a: Checkbox: token-driven size and focus ring, hidden check icon (no visual or API change).
- c6bc90e: Checkmark: size from canonical scale (`size-4`, value-identical 1rem, part of #367).
- 8aab3c2: Checkmark: size and draw animation use theme tokens; dash setup is path geometry (no visual or API change).
- bc62768: Docs: catalog fields for ConfirmDialog registry component pages (no API change).
- 77e8d1e: ConfirmDialog: keeps the props-bag API over Dialog (no styles of its own); trigger slot pinned by test.
- 293df49: DataTable: chrome geometry (stack, filter, sort, loading, pagination) uses theme tokens (no visual or API change).
- b1d317b: DataTable: adds composable `DataTableEmpty` (table output unchanged).
- 475ed85: Hide `DataTable` pagination when all rows fit on a single page.
- cb72a3c: DataTable: adds composable `DataTablePagination` (table output unchanged).
- 1664292: DataTable: adds composable `DataTableToolbar` (table output unchanged).
- ef23c2a: DetailPanel: row geometry uses theme tokens; adds composable `DetailPanelRow` (data API unchanged).
- 863f78c: Add `IconButton`, maturity-oriented `Badge` variants (`success`, `warning`), and darker `muted-foreground` in light mode for WCAG AA contrast.
- f890516: Export `BadgeProps` from the UI barrel so docs can reference the props type on registry component pages.
- 4a1b579: docs: accurate npm descriptions — UI kit is not admin-only; core is not backend-only.
- 7213de5: Export DrawerProps and catalog fields for the drawer registry doc page (part of #187).
- 5398c86: Drawer: content composed without `DrawerHeader`, `DrawerBody`, or `DrawerFooter` (a bare form, text, a list) now keeps the shared side gutters and clears the bottom safe area instead of touching the sheet edges. The slots carry `data-slot` markers. The admin dashboard demo and guide snippet compose the sheet with a handle, header, body, and footer.
- b7590da: Tokens: consolidate the three 0.875rem icon aliases into shared `--spacing-icon-sm` (no visual change).
- 7314c22: LivePulse: gap from canonical scale (`gap-1.5`, value-identical 0.375rem, part of #367).
- 9a0a2ec: Tokens: consolidate dialog/route-modal close offsets into shared `--spacing-overlay-close-offset` (no visual change).
- f9ba522: ProgressBar: segment gap and height use theme tokens (no visual or API change).
- 6ddbc95: `registry:check` now fails when `registry.json` theme `cssVars` / `css` drift from `packages/ui/src/styles.css`.
- 5f0e85d: RouteModal drawer variant: move focus inside on open so the focus trap engages (previously focus stayed on the trigger and Tab walked the background page). Matches the dialog variant; no API change.
- 3c11e6d: Consolidate the select item indicator box onto the shared `icon-sm` size token (same 0.875rem value, zero visual change, refs #367).
- ee95f6b: Switch: token-driven size, thumb travel, and focus ring (no visual or API change).
- ed3cd93: TabsList: scroll horizontally (`max-w-full overflow-x-auto`) instead of clipping on narrow widths.
- d501234: Tabs: list, trigger, and content geometry use theme tokens; focus ring uses the shared `focus-ring` utility (no visual or API change).
- e0e0625: Typography: add `asChild` composition to `Heading` and `Text`; heading anchor offset uses a theme token (`scroll-m-heading-scroll`).
- 88edb30: Alert: add `asChild` composition; padding and icon geometry use shared theme tokens (`px-alert-inline`, `top-alert-icon-offset`, `pl-alert-content-indent`).
- 747ec24: AppShell: sidebar width and main padding from `--spacing-app-shell-*` theme tokens (same rendered values — no visual change).
- 499d0b3: Badge: add `asChild` composition; padding and focus ring use shared theme tokens (`px-badge-inline`, `focus-ring`).
- ffbb1cf: Button: icon gap and default block padding use theme tokens (`gap-button-gap`, `py-control-block-lg`) instead of raw `gap-2` / `py-2` (same values).
- c1774ca: Button: control-height/button spacing theme tokens; `focus-ring-control` (1px, same keyboard focus as before — not Badge’s 2px `focus-ring`); fix `className` merge with `cn`.
- 0e501e7: Export the `CardProps` type for typed card overrides and generated docs.
- 5805d75: Card: header/content/footer/skeleton spacing from `--spacing-card-*` theme tokens (same rendered values — no visual change).
- da75051: Darken the light-theme `destructive` token so white text meets 4.5:1 contrast (was 3.6:1, failing axe color-contrast on destructive buttons and badges).
- 8c84a8d: Dialog: content centering from the `dialog-center` utility (`--spacing-dialog-center`) and elevation from `--shadow-overlay` (same rendered values — no visual change; replaces the `top-[50%]`/`translate-[-50%]`/`shadow-lg` literals).
- 525a365: Dialog: slot spacing, close offset, and overlay stacking from `--spacing-dialog-*` / `--z-index-overlay` tokens; close button uses the shared `focus-ring` and the kit `opacity-50` resting dim (was `opacity-70`). Same layout otherwise.
- dd17a5b: Drawer: stacking and content sizing use shared theme tokens (`z-overlay`, `max-h-drawer-max-height`, `sm:max-w-drawer-side`) instead of raw `z-50` / `max-h-[96dvh]` / `sm:max-w-md`.
- 863cd9e: Drawer: handle, header, and footer spacing use shared theme tokens instead of raw `mt-4` / `h-1.5 w-12` / `gap-*` / `p-4`.
- 4c3eece: Field compound layout: spacing via `gap-field-*` / `p-field-*` theme tokens (replaces raw `gap-6`, `gap-7`, `p-4`, etc.).
- 9ccec27: Form: item gap and description/message text size use shared theme tokens instead of raw `space-y-2` / `text-[0.8rem]`.
- 81cd2f2: Keep text fields at 16px or larger on touch and phone-width screens so iOS Safari no longer zooms the page when an `Input`, `Textarea`, `Select` trigger, `SecretField` or `DataTable` filter gets focus. Fields now read the new `--zk-input-font-size` token through the `text-control` utility; desktop keeps 14px.
- 0734dda: Input and Textarea: theme tokens for height, padding, and min-height; `focus-ring-control` (1px, unchanged from prior `ring-1`).
- e01face: Label: disabled peer dims to `opacity-50`, matching the kit-wide disabled convention (was `opacity-70`).
- 546c7b8: Export the `LabelProps` type for typed label overrides and generated docs.
- a9b8098: LivePulse: dot/label gap uses the shared theme token (`gap-live-pulse-gap`) instead of raw `gap-1.5`.
- 5f2215f: PageHeader and PageHeaderSkeleton: chrome spacing uses page-header tokens instead of raw `mb-6` / `gap-4` / `gap-2` (same values).
- db0a023: PageHeader: title/description stack uses the shared theme token (`space-y-page-header-title-gap`) instead of raw `space-y-1`.
- 7d9b0cf: RouteModal: drawer/dialog size props and close-button geometry use shared theme tokens instead of raw `max-w-*` / `top-4` / `h-4 w-4`.
- fa4d7e9: RouteModal: exit timing reads `--motion-slow`/`--motion-base` live instead of hand-mirrored constants, so themed motion durations stay in sync with the exit animation (same defaults otherwise).
- 09c501b: A scoped mist subtree (`data-identity-scope` with `data-identity="mist"`) now renders with the stock tokens under any page identity: colours (light and dark), radii, spacing, type scale, depth and motion no longer leak in from the page identity.
- 6cf491b: SecretField: row gap and copy/check icon size use shared theme tokens (`gap-secret-field-gap`, `size-icon-control`) instead of raw `gap-2` / `h-4 w-4`.
- ab35928: Select: content min-width uses the shared container token instead of arbitrary `min-w-[8rem]`.
- a4031d1: Select: label/item/separator spacing and indicator geometry use shared theme tokens instead of raw `px-2` / `py-1.5` / `pr-8` / `h-3.5 w-3.5` / `mx-1 my-1 h-px`.
- 3d43cc8: Select: content stacks on the shared `--z-index-overlay` token (`z-overlay`) instead of raw `z-50`; Radix runtime-var arbitraries documented as the allowed exception.
- b9aec64: Select: trigger and scroll buttons reuse the existing control tokens (`h-control-height`, `px-control-inline`, `py-control-block-lg`, `py-control-block`, `size-icon-control`, `focus-ring-control`) — no new tokens. Focus ring is now keyboard-only like the input pilot.
- aaeb113: Select: viewport padding and popper offsets reuse the select spacing token instead of raw `p-1` / `translate-*-1`.
- ff93465: Export the `SeparatorProps` type for typed separator overrides and generated docs.
- e60da25: Separator: thickness uses the shared theme token (`h-separator-thickness` / `w-separator-thickness`) instead of arbitrary `h-[1px]` / `w-[1px]`.
- 3c755c1: Export the `SkeletonProps` type for typed skeleton overrides and generated docs.
- afeaa6a: Toaster: re-export `toast` from the kit so docs and consumers need no direct `sonner` import; toast theme stays mapped to theme tokens.
- d8e69b7: StatusDot: dot size from the `--spacing-status-dot` theme token (same rendered value — no visual change). Tones already map to semantic color tokens.
- 05a5aed: StatusLabel: icon/text spacing from `--spacing-status-label-*` theme tokens (same rendered values — no visual change).
- bbaa116: Table: cell padding, head height, checkbox nudge and caption gap use shared theme tokens; structural selectors documented as the allowed arbitraries.
- 277069a: Export the `TabsProps` type for typed tabs overrides and generated docs.
- 160c50c: Export the `ToasterProps` type (re-exported from `sonner`) for typed toaster overrides and generated docs.
- d9ef8ae: Test that destructive and muted text pairs keep WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1) in both themes, so a token tweak cannot silently re-break downstream axe scans.
- 67d1ac8: UpdatedAgo: already token-driven (muted text tokens only); adds a live docs demo.
- d03a639: WizardSteps: geometry uses theme tokens; adds composable `Wizard` + `WizardStep` (data API unchanged).

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- e50d5ef: Add `RouteModal` (route-driven drawer/dialog that plays its exit before navigating back) and `closeRoute` (back-or-fallback close action for parallel/intercepting routes).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 1ee655e: Add faithful loading skeletons (`PageHeaderSkeleton`, `CardSkeleton`, `DataTableSkeleton`, `DetailPanelSkeleton`, each a named `role=status` zone) and pulse the base `Skeleton` only when motion is safe.
- a884cb5: Add `StatusLabel` (named inline operation status, `role=status`) and `UpdatedAgo` (stale-while-revalidate age stamp via `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`).

### Patch Changes

- 03cacd0: Catalog: every need documents its short name, audience, purpose, when to (not) use it, and related needs (single-sourced from CATALOG.md, enforced by `pnpm catalog:check`), feeding the doc pages.
- b2c3c0f: Animate overlays by default: Dialog fades/scales in and out, Drawer slides on kit motion tokens with a reduced-motion guard. No API change.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 5e9305e: Add `Drawer` (slide-in panel, `direction` top/right/bottom/left, side drawers full-width on mobile) wrapping `vaul` with the shadcn/ui drawer shape.
- 48fa6d8: Add state icons: `StatusDot` (motion-safe status dot), `ProgressBar` (determinate, `role=progressbar`), `Checkmark` (draw-once success check, static under reduced motion). `LivePulse` is rebased on `StatusDot` with identical output plus the reduced-motion guard.

### Patch Changes

- 59a12be: Discoverability: benefit-oriented descriptions, 8–12 npm keywords, homepage and bugs links per package (single-sourced from the CATALOG.md header, enforced by `pnpm catalog:check`), plus README badges and Install/Usage/When-to-use sections.
- c9c35aa: Mark shadcn-derived files (provenance header comments) and catalog entries (`Derived from:` flag, also in catalog.json); unmarked files are kit-authored.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 889d207: Re-release with build output: 0.1.0 shipped without dist/ (the release job published before building) and is unusable; use 0.1.1.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b664c35: Add the Alert family (Alert + Title/Description, default/destructive, shadcn source).
- bc6de49: Add AppShell (sidebar + topbar + main slots) and PageHeader (title + description + actions).
- f914184: Add the Card family (Card + Header/Title/Description/Content/Footer, shadcn source).
- 7d25f0e: Add DataTable filter input and pagination footer (TanStack global filter + pagination features).
- 617b596: Add DataTable (sortable TanStack Table wrapper with empty/loading/error states) and Table primitives.
- 9f6b122: Add DetailPanel (key-value rows) and LivePulse (live indicator), plus success/warning theme tokens.
- 18b1712: Add the Form brick: shadcn form (RHF wiring) + field primitives, useValidatedForm (zod schema from shared contracts), FormSubmit with pending state.
- e0d6de6: Initial release: admin UI kit scaffold — design tokens + dark/light theme CSS, cn() util, shadcn/ui-based toolchain (Radix, Tailwind v4, CVA, lucide, sonner, TanStack Table).
- 2db26ac: Add the layout helper family: Stack (direction + gap) + Section (titled content block).
- 0f7b3a0: Overlays slice: Dialog set, ConfirmDialog, themed Toaster, shown-once SecretField with copy.
- cec8f13: Primitives slice: Button, Badge, Input, Label, Separator, Skeleton (shadcn/ui-based).
- 878fec6: Add the Select family (Radix select primitives, shadcn source).
- 1c7256f: Add the Tabs family (Radix tabs primitives, shadcn source).
- 709b69f: Add the Textarea family (styled native textarea, shadcn source).
- 4b5209f: Add the Checkbox/Switch family (Radix primitives, shadcn sources).
- 5d8581d: Add the Typography family: Heading (levels 1-4, tag override) + Text (body/muted), following the documented shadcn typography recipes.
- fa382f5: Add WizardSteps (step indicator) and OptionCards (multi-select checkbox cards).

### Patch Changes

- cb519d1: Accessibility: SecretField accepts aria-label for its input; DataTable loading state uses aria-busy plus a labeled table instead of labeled skeleton divs.
- 0529e23: Consistent Tailwind class order; dialog overlay uses the new overlay theme token (same rendering).
- 16b564d: DataTable footer never shows page 0 (empty tables read Page 1 of 1).
- 781348a: Add "use client" to client-only modules so React Server Component adopters (Next.js) build: without it the server graph resolves client-only stubs (react-hook-form react-server) and fails.
