# AGENTS.md — @zedtech/zedkit-ui

UI kit. shadcn/ui-based (Radix + Tailwind v4, copied in —
see THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md), lucide icons, sonner toasts, TanStack
Table, react-day-picker calendars. Neutral/calm look; no custom
component may replace a mature primitive (ladder rung 5).

Rules:

- New code goes in `src/`, tests in `tests/unit/` (Testing
  Library + jsdom for rendered output, plain vitest otherwise).
- Animate triggers (`data-animate`, `<Animate>`): types, grammar and
  reduced-motion rules in [docs/animate-spec.md](docs/animate-spec.md).
- Every public export gets a `## <need>` entry in CATALOG.md
  (format in `docs/catalog/README.md`), then run
  `pnpm catalog:build` from the root.
- `src` ships in the tarball (`files`) on purpose — Tailwind
  scans component sources via the consumer's `@source` line.
  Keep class names literal (no dynamic construction) so the
  scanner finds them.
- `cn()` every `className` prop (conflicts resolve last-wins).
- `.dark`-class theming only; new tokens go in `src/styles.css`
  in both `:root` and `.dark`.
- Spacing: class names are roles (`gap-stack-*`, `px-field-pad`,
  `px-button-pad`, `size-icon`). Numbers stay in `calc(var(--spacing) * N)`
  so identity density still applies. Default scale steps are deprecated.
  Rem aliases stay so copied CSS resolves; do not add another name for the
  same value. `Stack` accepts `sm` | `md` | `lg` and, until a major, the
  numeric steps that map to the same classes. The shipped rule is
  `packages/ai/kit/skills/setup-ai/design-policy.md` (host vocabulary;
  this package is the host). Phone targets are 44px, stricter than the
  kit's 24px floor.
- React 19 ref-as-prop: `ComponentProps<"el">`, ref is a prop, no
  `forwardRef` (lint in the quality preset). Each exported host sets
  `data-slot` on its root (see `src/button.tsx`).
- Kit chrome strings come from `ZedkitUiProvider` (English default, `zedkitUiMessagesFr`
  for French). A label prop on the host wins. Do not hard-code
  `aria-label` / `title` / `placeholder` literals in `src/`.
- No `any`, no `ts-ignore`; no eslint-disable except with a cited
  upstream reason in the comment (one exists: TanStack's own
  `ColumnDef<TData, any>` for mixed-value columns).
- UI PRs: the PR body carries the four lenses plus a UX pass as a
  lazy, distracted, doubtful end user (can they finish the flow
  half-asleep?), and attaches a gallery screenshot showing the
  change (`pnpm --filter @zedtech/zedkit-ui smoke` writes them to
  test-results/, never committed).
- Token and primitive fixes belong here; which layer owns a given fix, and
  the known traps (overlay is a sibling, calendar grid hover, identity
  `--spacing`, `overflow-clip` on pinned scenes, fixed containing blocks), are
  in [VISUAL-CONTRACT.md](../../apps/docs/VISUAL-CONTRACT.md), not restated
  here. After source changes, rebuild this package before judging the docs
  site.
- Public repo: generic wording only, no private project names
  anywhere (CI denylist enforces it).
