# AGENTS.md — apps/docs

Public documentation site (Next.js). Renders the catalog: generated
pages per need, live kit previews, props tables, maturity badges.
Neutral, professional tone throughout (a CI check bans
self-promotional marketing terms — see scripts/check-tone.sh).

## Purpose and role

Reading surface of the kit: a developer reads a need, sees the live
component, copies the example. Reads `docs/catalog/` + the workspace
packages; owns no component logic. Out of scope: kit components
themselves (live in `packages/ui`), catalog content (lives in each
package `CATALOG.md`).

## Mental model

Manifest-driven: `docs-manifest.json` maps catalog needs to demos;
the generator embeds demos by key; the docs check fails on drift
(missing demo, renamed need). Demos render the REAL workspace
components (same import a consumer writes), inside one shared frame.

## Demo rules (blocking — the `ui` lens fails the review otherwise)

1. One demo = one file in `components/demos/<name>.tsx` (or
   colocated with its doc). Never a grab-bag module. Feature-folder
   examples live under `features/<name>/`, not under `components/demos`;
   they are not kit demos and skip the shared frame and demo registry.
2. Every demo renders inside the shared frame (title, description,
   light/dark preview, shown source, props link) and registers in
   the demo registry (key -> demo). Doc pages import the registry,
   never dozens of components directly.
3. Doc pages stay thin: load content + doc layout only.
4. Zero raw structural HTML, zero ad-hoc styles (`div flex gap…`):
   `Stack`/`Section`/`Heading`/`Text` from the kit, tokens only.
   The same bar as `packages/ui` applies here.
5. The bulk-import ban (lint rule or test) must fail on the grab-bag
   it replaces and pass after — keep that proof green.

## Registry (`/r/*.json`)

Copy-paste install payloads for the official shadcn CLI (#187). `pnpm
registry:build` (root) rewrites `packages/ui` imports, runs `shadcn
build`, and writes gitignored JSON under `public/r/`. Docs `prebuild`
runs that step; `registry:check` asserts rewritten imports and
`shadcn registry validate`. CI job `registry-smoke` runs
`pnpm registry:smoke` (fresh Next + `shadcn add` for Badge and Drawer).
Home install copy comes from `registry.json` via `content/registry-site.ts`
(`docs:generate`). `check-registry-urls.mjs` and `check-seo-export.mjs`
reject dead `/r/<name>.json` links.

## Work on it

- `pnpm --filter @zedtech/zedkit-docs dev` (or root `pnpm dev`, :3100).
- Gates: `typecheck`, `lint`, `build` on the filter; docs check runs
  in CI (`docs: ok (N pages cover N needs)`).
- Done = gates green + manifest/check in sync + screenshots for
  visual changes + demo rules respected (lint proves it).

## Boundaries

- Always: demo rules above, manifest keys matching catalog needs.
- Ask first: new docs deps, new preview harness, deployment changes.
- Never: component logic here; unexported types promised in props
  tables; weakening the docs check or the bulk-import ban to fit.
